# Code Style

## Functions

- Single responsibility — do one thing well
- Limit parameters to 3; use an options object for more
- Prefer pure functions; isolate side effects
- Use early returns to reduce nesting

## Comments

- Explain "why", not "what" — the code shows what, comments explain intent
- Delete commented-out code; version control exists
